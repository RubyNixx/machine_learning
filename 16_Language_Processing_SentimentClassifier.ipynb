was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boy's that played the part's of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be

many animation buffs consider wladyslaw starewicz the great forgotten genius of one special branch of the art puppet animation which he invented almost single handedly and as it happened almost accidentally as a young man starewicz was more interested in entomology than the cinema but his unsuccessful attempt to film two stag beetles fighting led to an unexpected breakthrough in film making when he realized he could simulate movement by manipulating beetle carcasses and photographing them one frame at a time this discovery led to the production of amazingly elaborate classic short the cameraman's revenge which he made in russia in 1912 at a time when motion picture animation of all sorts was in its infancy br br the political tumult of the russian revolution caused starewicz to move to paris where one of his first productions coincidentally was a dark political satire variously known as frogland or the frogs who wanted a king a strain of black comedy can be found in almost all of films but here it is very dark indeed aimed more at grown ups who can appreciate the satirical aspects than children who would most likely find the climax upsetting i'm middle aged and found it pretty upsetting myself and indeed prints of the film intended for english speaking viewers of the 1920s were given title cards filled with puns and quips in order to help soften the sharp sting of the finale br br our tale is set in a swamp the frogland commonwealth where the citizens are unhappy with their government and have called a special session to see what they can do to improve matters they decide to beseech jupiter for a king the crowds are impressively animated in this opening sequence it couldn't have been easy to make so many frog puppets look alive simultaneously while jupiter for his part is depicted as a droll white bearded guy in the clouds who looks like he'd rather be taking a nap when jupiter sends them a tree like god who regards them the frogs decide that this is no improvement and demand a different king irritated jupiter sends them a stork br br delighted with this formidable looking new king who towers above them the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries the mayor steps forward to hand him the key to the commonwealth as newsreel cameras record the event to everyone's horror the stork promptly eats the mayor and then goes on a merry rampage swallowing citizens at random a title card dryly reads news of the king's appetite throughout the kingdom when the now terrified frogs once more beseech jupiter for help he loses his temper and showers their community with lightning bolts the moral of our story delivered by a hapless frog just before he is eaten is let well enough alone br br considering the time period when this startling little film was made and considering the fact that it was made by a russian émigré at the height of that beleaguered country's civil war it would be easy to see this as a parable about those events starewicz may or may not have had russia's turmoil in mind when he made frogland but whatever prompted his choice of material the film stands as a cautionary tale of universal application frogland could be the soviet union italy germany or japan in the 1930s or any country of any era that lets its guard down and is overwhelmed by tyranny it's a fascinating film even a charming one in its macabre way but its message is no joke\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":44}],"source":["# FALSE NEGATIVE\n","\n","'
